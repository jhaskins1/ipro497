## Top Two to Three Scenarios
[see sample scenarios](https://github.com/mschray/IPro497Sample/blob/main/Examples/ScenarioExample.md)

### Your Scenario #1
> Our friend Robert has been quite busy lately with exams and has one more tomorrow to wrap up his exam week. At the same time, he also wants to use his time productively at dinner and spend it with leisure before he resumes his studies which he has been doing since morning. He doesn’t like to watch a movie that is not suited to his liking, as it will waste his time. Before he starts eating, he logs in to the movie recommendation application on his laptop and puts Netflix as the streaming service he has access to. Based on his ratings of the movies he’s watched previously on Netflix, he uses the application to figure out the movie he’d watch and proceeds to watch it on Netflix.
### Your Scenario #2
> A family of 5 has movie night every Friday. The family feels as though they have hit a brick wall and have seen every movie that has come out. Every movie option that they see suggested to them either looks dull and boring, or doesn't resemble any of the genres they like. They are in desperate need for recommendations that are catered towards them. The application created, will fill this void by requiring user ratings to determine what movies to suggest and what movies to not, making movie night fresh and full of movies recommended to watch.
### Your Scenario #3
> Ben forgot movie night was tonight and he wasn't sure what to put on, so he opened up *app name*, one that he had previously put it what movies he had seen and liked it, or favorite genre. From which he can get some movies recommendation to swipe through, choosing what pique his interests or save it into personal list for next movie nights
