# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 8 ##
- Sean's audio seems to be choppy every class
- Like the name, NewVie, it's clever
- People over 30 have a lack of time as well.
- Consider sharing an app not the while screen or having a second monitor to allow to check notifications on another model
- Scenarios are solid
- TMDB is a good find
- Get a free website on GPE, AWS or Azure
- Nice to have the team help with multi-value
- No code to show?  Move beyond design
 
## Week 9 ##
- Your team has not setup the tabs for the sprint review.  Please create a story to do this (https://github.com/mschray/IPro497Sample/blob/main/Course%20Content/SprintReviewProjectViews.md)
- Know who your sprint review lead is before the instructor arrives
- Let's improve story quality by ensuring all stories have acceptance criteria
- Think demo of your product when I arrive for sprint review - who is going to demo
- Know who your sprint review lead is before the instructor arrives

## Week 10 ##
- Stories need acceptance criterion
- Make sure you are using your class time effectively - I allow you as much class time as possible to do you work in class
- Please be ready to demo - when you have working code demoing should not be a big deal

## Week 11 ##

- Think about the stories that you need to complete for the final demo

## Week 12 ##

- Focus on coding work that shows the unique value of your product
- For the dry run week, I'll give you about an hour of time to organize yourselves via team work time and then we'll all come back to the main room and I'll pick teams to present in random order
## Week 14 ##
- Good logo
- SVD - tell us what that means - what is SVD
- Specification - less text you are talking to me. Just short bullets
- Think less text because your presenting the slides
- Scenario 1 - so much text 
- Nice logo
- Avoid using the admin login - try to create a specific user
- Do the demo as a user working through on of the scenarios - not it does this and this and this.
